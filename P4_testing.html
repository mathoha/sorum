            <h2>Testing document</h2>
            <p>We asked general questions about age and gender and what browsers and devices was used. We also asked what they thought of the front-page and how easy the site was to navigate. And finally two questions where they could type what they liked and disliked about the site. Google-form (questions in Norwegian):

            <h2>Tester audience</h2>
            <p>Our testers was mainly young adults in age range 18-30, but also some over 50. We shared it via Facebook so we got a variety of different-minded testers as Facebook is a community where there all kinds of people. Gender wise it was about 50/50. Sadly we weren’t able to perform live-testing.</p>

            <h2>Testing platforms</h2>
            <p>Our testers used tablets, laptops, desktops and phones, so we got a wide variety of devices tested. Our testers was able to use whichever browser they wanted, although they only used Safari and Chrome.</p>

            <h2>Feedback summary</h2>
            
            <h3>Design:</h3>
		    <p>This aspect was where we got the most criticism. Some thought the news-page was a little empty and and the front-page was abit off, mainly because the pictures was a bit squeezed. This is partly due to that we didn’t have the widest selection of images to choose from. The testers over 50 also thought the slideshow changed images too fast.</p>
            
            <h3>Content:</h3>
            <p>Most testers thought this was done well, but some thought that our site provided info that seemed a bit much like a commercial. The text was also criticised for not being well-written and unprofessional. Many people liked that the site wasn’t overwhelming and focused on the most important parts.</p>
            
            <h3>Usability and navigation</h3>
            <p>Our usability scored high. Most people found the site easy to navigate and well-structured. We gave the testers a task to find some info and almost all of them found the info with ease.</p>
            
            <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>Our site could be more responsive as some the testers experienced some overlapping on the front-page and sometimes had odd spaces in the text.</p>

            <h2>Your response</h2>
            
            <p>We should probably get some new images, as we only had access to the images on Sørum’s Facebook. We should also make some additions to the news-page to fill up the void. The front-page could maybe also use some redesign. Other than that it we could also  make it more responsive by using additional media-queries.</p>

            <h2>Self reflection</h2>
            
            <p>Even if our website may not be the best one, we will still consider us happy about the project. We learnt that some things takes more time than we thought and the importance of thorough planning. We also learnt that github is a nice tool when working on the same project. When working in a team we also learnt to listen to each other's ideas, and if we disagreed on something we learnt to find a suitable solution. We also learnt to interact with a client. And off course we learnt a lot about html, css and javascript, and also that if your code work on your computer it doesn’t necessarily mean that it works on someone else’s.</p>
