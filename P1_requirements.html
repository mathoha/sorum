		<h2>Our Client</h2>
		<p>Client: Sørum Silketrykk.
		<br>Contact person: Gary Poulton.</p>

		<p>The names of our clients are Gary Poulton and Nils Sørum who own Sørum Silketrykk 50-50. Nils founded the business in 1989, and both of them have over 30 years of experience in the print industry. Their main profit source comes from providing marketing material (for example print on clothes, print on company cars and logo signs) to local businesses, but they also have a physical store with general construction apparel and office supplies. Occasionally they also do printing work for individuals. Gary Poulton is the stepfather of Matias, and that’s how the group got connected with the company.</p>

		<h2>Purpose and Goals:</h2>
		<p>The main goal of the site is to increase sales. We hope to achieve this by effectively marketing the products Sørum Silketrykk offer. This will be done by making an informative and persuasive website. The information should be precise and relevant for the visiting customer. The majority of the site content will consist of descriptive text and images showcasing the different products offered by Sørum Silketrykk. The business offers custom designed print on all kinds of objects and surfaces. We will try to showcase the full range of products they offer, by showing images of quality products they have made in the past. We will also provide a “contact us” page and a map of the business location. We will optimize the site for search engines to increase the number of visits to the site, and we will make the website accessible for users with disabilities. We aim to make the website look professional to reflect the quality of the business.</p>

		<h2>Target Audience:</h2>
		<p>The primary customers of Sørum Silketrykk are other local businesses. This includes both very small businesses, and larger ones with dozens of workers. Some of them just need general office supplies and/or work apparel, while others (also) feel a need to market themselves. They need clear information of all the services Sørum provides, to know if Sørum can help solve their needs. They also need to know whether Sørum provides a quality service, and this will be proven by providing pictures of finished products. In order to make a deal or inquire about Sørums services, they need to know how to contact them. Many may also want to visit their store or talk to the owners in person, and for that they need to know where Sørum Silketrykk is located. Individuals also buy products and services from Sørum Silketrykk. They have the same informational needs as businesses, but don't have a need to market themselves.</p>

		<h2>Content and site organization:</h2>
		<p>We plan to organize the website in the following sub-pages:</p>
		
		<h3>Hjem</h3>
		<p>This will be the home page. It is the first page the meets the visitor and it will introduce the visitor to the basic idea of what this page will contain. The home page should clearly show what the website is about and how to navigate the website. This site can be compared to the front-cover of a book.</p>
		
		<h3>Om oss</h3>
		<p>Should contain information about their history, business and a general description about what products they are able to deliver and who the intended customers are.</p>
		
		<h3>Nyheter</h3>
		<p>Sørum Silketrykk have a facebook page where they often post updates. On this news page we will embed their facebook-feed so the visitors can get recent updates. This will also be good for Sørum as they don’t need to make actual changes to the website, when they want it updated, but they can instead easily post a facebook-update</p> 
		
		<h3>Produkter</h3>
		<p>Products will be showcased with pictures of great projects they have done in the past. We will diffrentiate the product range into logcial categories to make it easier for the customer to find what he is looking for. For now we have divided the product range into the following sub-pages:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Bildekor</li>
			<li>T-skjortetrykk</li>
			<li>Etiketter / Streamers</li>
			<li>Profileringsartikler</li>
			<li>Reklameskilt</li>
			<li>Skilt/Fasadeutsmykning</li>
			<li>Laminering</li>
		</ul>
		
			
		
		<h3>Butikk</h3>
		<p>This page will contain information about the physical store where they sell general construction apparel and office supplies.</p>

		<h3>Kontakt</h3>
		<p>Here you will find contact information, opening hours and a map of where the business is located.</p>
